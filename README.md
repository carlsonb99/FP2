### My Library: xml, net/url
Brian Carlson

For this exploration, I took a look at and explored some tutorial code that used TCP connections to create an HTTP server. 
The server uses the xml library to convert expressions for the HTTP to send in its header. The net/url Library converts string to URLs, HTML and Paths.
